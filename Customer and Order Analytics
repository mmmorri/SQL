/**In this project we were given Customer Order data from from several months and spread across multiple tables. The data in the customers table had multiple issues, such as missing values or incorrect values and needed to be filtered. In the solutions I focused on querying the database, and for some joining tables, to quantity statistics about the customer and order data.**/
